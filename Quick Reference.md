The land of Riis was once a barren wasteland, devoid of life and hostile to any trying to colonize it, purely by its barren nature. However, pilgrims to this land were able to invent a device, both magical and mechanical in nature, that was able to harness a force to terraform the land into a healthy, bountiful place where life could take root. This technology was lost to time, through the hubris of the wizards of Roaneyll, who grew to mistrust the Cambarians that maintained the device. The Cambarians were highly protective of their methods of hybridizing magic and mechanics, and this scared the Roaneyllian ruling class, who feared some ploy to take their power. The division between the sister towns slowly grew until they became isolated from each other, and without the magic support of Roaneyll, Cambar slowly lost their ability to maintain the device, due to spending so much time and effort on farming and construction projects to maintain their growing population. Roaneyll, without technological assistance from Cambar, stagnated in their ability to effectively manage their surrounding villages and began a slow descent into mediocrity.

Today, Riis is a shadow of its former self, with much of the population remembering the "good old days", where things were plenty. Now, many have enough to get by, but just barely. Crops yield less, animals are becoming scarce, and natural construction resources are slowly drying up. Murmurs of conflict in the more remote northern villages is spreading, and confidence in Roaneyllian rule is at an all-time low. Cambarian pride keeps them from seeing the truth about their failure to maintain the terraforming device, and the people are beginning to suffer for it.

Now, there seems to be little hope to restore the land to its former glory, and many seem to think the only hope left is to leave. Some of the older townsfolk of the first village established on the island, Baerth, speak of a savior from the north, but many call this ramblings of the elders, merely stories to give the young ones false hope. The young villagers generally believe abandoning Riis is their only option, as it is a lost cause to try to restore it.
