# Session 1
Begin with Scoop entering the village just before dusk, he is seeking out supplies from the town to prepare for his unknown next adventure. As he enters the town, he notices many windows are dark, doors seem locked, like nobody is home anywhere. Soft notes of music echo down the dark streets, with glimmering firelight just reaching a few feet from where he stands

*Scoop follows the light to the town square*

As you approach the source of the light, you notice a cacophany of voices swell over the soft music, and rounding a corner into the town square you are met with an image of revelry. The townspeople are celebrating what seems like some kind of harvest festival, and you remember that tonight marks the summer solstice, an auspicious time in all of Riis, marking both the end of the harvest and the anniversary of when the great machine first came to life. Their faces are worn and weather-beaten, their eyes tired and their cheeks a bit sunken, but tonight they seem to be simply enjoying this season's harvest. A host of races adorn the many tables in the square, it seems as though the party may be still picking up. 

*If Scoop sits at a table, he notices Luffy in a drinking contest with the dragonborn tavern owner, Jann Halftoe*

*If he looks for a store to get supplies, he notices one building with flickering lights inside*

*If he speaks to a townsperson, they beckon him to approach and hand him a flagon of ale, laughing at the foreigner's odd clothing but welcoming them anyways. A clap on the back precedes an invitation to sit at their table with Jann and Luffy*

*Daenerys is introduced next, approaching the table with two other townspeople, laughing with them and enjoying the revelry. The townspeople with her ask those at the table if they've met Daenerys yet, as they praise her for her generous donations towards the decor and entertainment for the festival. "You'd think she's some kind of royalty, with all that money!" They joke drunkenly, stumbling away as Daenerys is left by the table.*

*Scoop notices a hooded figure is sitting on the edge of the torchlight, bent over a thick, old-looking tome of some kind. They are feverishly studying the arcane scrawl on the pages, oblivious to the festival, only here to take advantage of the free food and light.*

`Party gets introduced, they drink and socialize a bit.`

After some time, people start drunkenly dancing, and the tables empty out a bit. *DC 6 PERCEPTION CHECK HERE!* You notice a scrawny-looking young Tiefling girl standing on the edge of the square, chewing on a piece of obviously hard bread. Her clothes are threadbare, and she has no shoes on. She looks at the table of food hungrily, seemingly gathering courage to step into the light and take a piece. As she takes a step, she is yanked backwards quickly by some unseen force and disappears into the alleyway. Her yelp of surprise is drowned out by the music, but you clearly see the fear etched into her face as she disappears into the darkness.

*assuming they follow*

You track the obvious signs of struggle down the alleyway, leading towards the ocean bay that Baerth is built around. *DC 10 investigation check reveals two pairs of footsteps that vary wildly in pattern, as if their owners are stumbling around and generally uncoordinated*

As they round a corner to see the bay, the footsteps continue south, towards what looks like a lone dock and encampment.

Reaching the clearing, you see a docked boat and a makeshift camp. *DC 10 perception reveals enemy positions and Mol as well. This also reveals the necromancer's robes, clearly those of a Vecna cultist. Cawdia and Daenerys recognize it if they pass, otherwise they can be told this information. If they continue into the clearing they see zombies only.*

*Fight ends with the necromancer escaping with Mol, clearly heading to a small island a few miles away. As the players watch the boat leave, they watch the island begin to glow with an eerie green light, coinciding with midnight's arrival. Session end! (maybe). Otherwise if they return to the village they can get help from Jann to acquire a boat and some healing potions in order to pursue the necromancer.*

Group inspected the orphanage and found Mol missing, so they got a boat from Jann and headed to the island. They convinced merfolk to not fight them and landed at the island.


# Session 2 - Save Mol and End the Dark Ritual


*As you step off your boat, you feel magic in the air. The weave feels off, somehow. Distorted, twisted. The source of the green light has grown brighter, as you can barely make out some kind of glow on the islands ahead of you. You see a sturdy stone bridge, connecting the small island you landed at to a larger one ahead of you.*

*Velk is a tall, lanky half-elf. He looks young, and utterly terrified. He speaks nervously, mentioning he'd only been here since a few days ago, as he'd finished his lackluster wizard training in the main city and then been told to venture here to help his master, Rohan Marr, maintain the magic ritual being held here.*

*Velk explains that the necromancer arrived at the island shortly before you, starting a dark, necromantic ritual on the main island's dais. The ritual is piggybacking off of the power source on the island, which was enacted generations ago as one of many 'batteries' that were used to power the ancient machine, drawing magic from the weave itself. He explains that there are two powerful magic artifacts used to gain information about and control the ritual, and that he is in possession of one: The stone of sight. His master left it with him when he had left to visit another of these ritual sites in the north, intending to diagnose the problem with the other sites in order to try and restore the ancient machine's power source. This is the last on in Riis that is functional. He says the second artifact used to be located on a ritual pedestal ahead, but that all he knows is that the two pedestals are connected somehow, and that the other artifact is named the hammer of control. The hammer disappeared in the past, locking them out of controlling the rituals and removing the ancient machine's power source. The necromancer's ritual begins after he finishes this, raising a massive wall of green fire around the dais on the main island.*

*As the group steps near to a pedestal, they find the hammer of control. It shimmers in and out of existence, as if obscured by some magic field, though they can tell it won't hurt them. Picking it up makes it normal. Once picked up, a green portal opens between the two crystal areas, and a skeleton and two bats walk out.*

*MECHANICS: Use the stone of sight to tell whoever is holding the hammer of control which crystal's base is glowing. The hammer has a red crystal jutting out of it that seems suspiciously crafted to fit into an opening in the crystal's base. This costs a bonus action. Placing the hammer into the wrong crystal spawns a new bat, and every 3 wrong spawns a skeleton.*

*After successfully powering down the ritual, the necromancer's fire begins to sputter out. Her minions collapse to the ground, their magic no longer animating them. She looks at the group with rage as a firey green portal opens behind her. She screams in pain, screaming that she is sorry and won't fail again. Skeletal hands reach out of the portal, pulling her into some hellish dimension and the portal closes. As the portal's magic dissipates, it emits some kind of black fire, obviously magical. `DC 18 CON SAVE` The group realizes they've been cursed, feeling an odd prickle on their neck, a barely-there feeling of unease, like someone is watching them. Mol lays on the stone floor, passed out but alive, and somehow unaffected by the curse.*

*The hammer shimmers out of existence at this point, seemingly pulled from your hand by some magical force.*

*Upon leaving the island, they can choose to explain what happened to Velk. He'll mention that the high wizards of Roaneyll must've felt a disturbance in the weave, and finding the hammer to once again be on Riis, teleported it away to guard it. He notes that the hammer's reappearance must have something to do with the solstice, as it has always been an auspicious time for Riis. The ritual here will slowly dissipate, but he'll do what he can with his limited knowledge to maintain it for now. He notes that there are other arcane batteries spread across Riis like this one, and though their rituals ended long ago, it is possible to restore them now that you know of the power of the hammer and the stone of sight. The batteries are one piece of the puzzle of the ancient machine, which brings a glint of hope to his eye. He can tell the group the powers of the armor and the dagger, if they ask him if he's seen them before. He bids the group farewell, as he seems to have a renewed sense of purpose.*

*Assuming they bring Mol back, she is revived by a Jann, and wakes up remembering nothing from after she was taken from the harvest festival. Everyone is shaken up, and Jann recommends trying to find this master of Velk's, Rohan. He may have answers about the ritual, the hammer, and the solstice. He suggests also going to Roaneyll and finding the wizards, maybe they can help too. Lastly, he thanks the group, offering his magic services as well as giving them 100gp apiece.*

*The group can stay in the orphanage for a night to long rest, and leaves the next day, traveling wherever they want to.*

*Roll a d20 just cause lol*

*As the group arrives near the ruins, dusk has fallen. Once they poke through the building (if no long rest) Mephistopheles appears in front of them.*

"My, my! What do we have here? A band of adventurers, on their way to redemption? Or merely marching to their eventual damnation? Time will tell...Well met, adventures. It is I, Mephistopheles, very much at your service. *bows*"

"Who am I? Merely a silent observer, prepared to speak, but ready to take an opportunity when it presents itself. I am no enemy, I am a friend! And friends like I, well, we prefer to speak about important matters in a more...pleasant location *looks around, raising a foot out of the dirt slightly* Come come, we have much to discuss about your...condition. *He waves his hand, and everyone finds themselves in a new place*"

"Ah, much better. Welcome to my manor, my home. This is the house of healing, where lost souls come to be...fixed. Now, where was I? Ah! I almost forgot my manners. Please, enjoy the meal I've laid out for you. It may just be your last."

"Why, that wasn't a threat, merely just experience. *He then transforms into his true form*"

"Yes, yes I still mean no harm. Simply here to offer an accord. I understand you've found yourselves with a new, magical affliction, am I not correct? I offer a solution to this teensy little problem of yours."

"In return? Well, you're making a deal with a devil. I'm sure you can try to guess what that could cost."

"Ah, you think you can cure it yourselves? Try your best, I doubt much will come to pass. And I know, eventually, when all your options have been exhausted, you'll come running back to my door. It's only a matter of time... *smiles at them knowingly* Ta-ta! *He waves his hand, and they are transported back to their campsite.*"


# Session 3 - The Journey to Roaneyll (swamp episode)

The party wakes, assuming travel
Roll 3 d20 to see if combat (<10 means combat)

## IF COMBAT
1 Rotbeast + 3 Zombies in the shrine

The group arrives at the swamp:
*As you arrive at the swamp, a moist, peaty smell invades your nostrils. Though it is daytime, something seems...off about these lands. The shadows seem darker, and almost seem to move when they are at the edge of your vision. An eerie blue-green glow faintly emanates from the water, and your necks prickle with the power of the shadow curse on you.*

As the group enters the swamp, they find the bodies of two gnomes. They are wearing druidic clothing, clearly familiar to `Scoop`. He recognizes them as inhabitants of his swamp village. 

*The two gnomes' bodies are half-buried in the wet mud. Their clothes show no signs of struggle, and no blood is found on their bodies. Turning them over reveals sunken, soulless eyes, and the veins in their faces are engorged and black. They've clearly succumbed to the shadow curse...*

If the group leaves the bodies behind without burying or burning them, they transform into ghouls and attack.

# Session 4 - The Corvid Necromancer

*As you enter the room, a dark figure stands in the corner. They turn slowly, raising their hands as their hoods falls to reveal a black beak. Combat begins.*

*As the corvid sorcerer lays dying, they croak out "you fools...you've wasted your time, my job is completed.*

The group arrives at the ruined temple, determined to save Scoop's parents (they don't know his parents are there)

# Session 5 - Dungeon Crawling to save the gnomes

*The group continues to delve into the dungeon, finding more floors and continuing to face resistance*

*They end up finding the gnome couple, Tinker and Qili half-awake, delirious from blood loss. Their clothes are stained with blood and dirt, and the veins on their hands seem darker than they should be.*

The couple can be helped up, helping them walk is allowable. The shadows created by the torches seem to dance more than they should be, and are strangely darker, seemingly trying to 'move' towards the gnome couple.

After moving into the next room, Scoop's mom collapses, and his dad follows suit next.

*The shadows grow longer, darker still, and a blue-green smoky energy seeps from the cracks between the stones underneath them. The smoke flows into the bodies of the gnome couple, and they both begin choking as their bodies succumb to the shadow curse, transforming them into shadow-thralls. Combat begins.*

# Session 6 - Fight Scoop's parents, and set off to save what's left of his village

*The bodies are transformed by the curse, deformed and bloated, but still recognizable. On the female gnome's body is a small pendant necklace. The pendant is carved from wood, a small animal that looks like a deer. Scoop recognizes this as a carving he made as a child when he was growing up with them. The male gnome was carrying a small, simple silver ring, adorned with a carving in elvish. The carving is a short, druidic hymn, praising Silvanus.*

*Upon exiting the dungeon, the air seems to have changed. The floor has a thin layer of fog, tinted with a light blue-green color. It seems as though the shadow curse is getting stronger.*

*Navigating to the druid village finds most of the inhabitants centered on a small tavern-style building, ringed with a thick layer of the shadow-fog, as though there is an invisible barrier holding it at bay. An idol of Silvanus is placed above the door frame, ringed in a soft glow.*

*The tavern is filled with 30 or so villagers, somberly milling about. The bartender has a stern look on his face, but his expression softens when he sees Scoop. He waves him over:*

"Scoop my boy, glad to see you're okay. It's been a long while since you've left, and obviously things have changed a bit. We're considering abandoning the village, thank Silvanus we've survived enough to gather here. He is the only thing keeping that damned curse at bay. It started a few weeks ago, first with the plants, then the animals, the crick, and then...then our people...*sighs* they started to change too. The elders were hit the hardest. Turned into mindless abominations. We...we had to strike them down to protect the others. We're all that's left. Our village...*places his head in his hands*it's been corrupted beyond our control. Those damn necromancers are the cause of this, but for what reason I don't know. It started in Lord Anglemar's manor, but they moved to old Feldmar's fields to the west, out near the coast. *He notices Luffy* You...have we met before? I used to be a sailor, but that was long ago. But I'd recognize that hat anywhere...You're not him, but must know Shanks, then. Smart kid, when I knew him at least."

*If he is told about Scoop's parents, he chokes back tears and his voice gets gravelley:* "Hells. They disappeared a few days ago but we couldn't spare anyone to search for them. We've lost our fighters. Those damn necromancers keep taking good people from us. I'm sorry Scoop, I know how much they meant to you. We'll remember them. They are with Silvanus now. For their sake, and ours, please. Please end this curse...for the land, the animals, your people. We need you now."

*To end the curse* "All I know is the arm of Silvanus was taken, and the curse began. I'd wager it must be restored in the temple ruins in order to put this to rest, but those necromancers stole it when they moved to Feldmar's fields."

# Session 8 - Find the source of the curse in Feldmar's farm

*As the crew fights their way to the well, they begin to hear a rhythmic thumping in their chests...all but Luffy. The thumping is coming from the south side of the village*

*Once the group finds the house: The thumping grows into a loud, booming sound. It fills your ears, drowning out even your heartbeats. Power surges from the house, growing to incomprehensible levels. You feel a looming sense of dread emanating, and for the first time in your short journey together, the odds that are stacked against you may be too much to overcome...*

*Upon door open: A blast of green energy erupts from the door. You are all knocked back 10ft.*

**DC 18 CON SAVE TO AVOID PARALYSIS** 

*You see the Corvid necromancer chanting furiously over a pile of dead bodies, one on the top possibly still alive. Most are older folk, all from Scoop's druid village. He turns to see you open the door, and simply smiles. A bright green fire begins to erupt from under the bodies, slowly engulfing them in flames. You should be feeling their heat by now, but all you feel is cold. Dread, cold and uncaring, emanates from the house in place of the heat that is missing from the flames. The necromancer raises their hands, screaming in glee:* 

"You fools thought you could stop me? Take the staff! End the curse! It is of no matter to me now. This farce, this falsehood, this deception of Vecna's followers by me only needs to be held for a short while longer. In fact...I need just a bit more power. *His eyes light up, as he looks at the group. He seems to smirk, a laugh tinged with insanity escaping his throat* And only one of you isn't under the protection of that damned devil! HA! my failure to curse you all at the island seems to have worked out in my favor! This is clearly a blessing from my dear, late Vecna. His power surges through me! I am his heir! I AM CHOSEN!" 

*With that, the necromancer's hands raise completely, and the green flames begin to swirl. They rapidly flow into his hands, like water from a dam, and his eyes begin to glow even brighter. The flames swell, and the last of them rush into his hands. He turns, setting his sights on Luffy.*

**DC 12 CON SAVE TO AVOID 2d10 psychic damage** 

*His hands drop, and he begins to stumble towards Luffy, with a manical face, revealing his insanity.*

"With this, my work can truly begin. Thank you, truly, for this gift."

*He raises his hands, clasping them together into a fist in front of his face. The next moment, his body is again engulfed in the green flames, which quickly grow into a massive, cold, firestorm. The flames seem to reach an apex, and then begin to slam down. Luffy is hit with the fire, and gets completely smothered. You hear him begin to scream in agony, as he is the only one who can feel the heat of the fire. You all watch helplessly, as his body begins to melt. The flames rend flesh from bone, and his voice dies out as the breath is taken from his lungs. You see him reach out towards you in a futile attempt to escape, and he falls, his body burning away into the fire. The flames seem to grow larger, brighter, colder, and then they rush back into the necromancer. He turns and looks at you all, walking up to the charred bones of your faithful companion. He chuckles, and then a laugh only loosed by those who have truly been broken erupts from his throat again. He kicks the half-burned straw hat towards the group, walking past you. As he passes each of you, you receive a swift kick to the head, **taking 1d4 damage each.***

"Fools, all of you, to think you could fight a man blessed by a lost god. See what it feels like to have someone you care about taken from you? The emptiness? Revel in it. Let it make you stronger. It won't matter, in the end."

*And with that, he leaves, and the village continues to burn. Your failure to apprehend the leader of this cult will have consequences, for all of Riis...*

**SESSION END**

# Session 9 - What now?

*As he leaves, you feel the paralysis slowly begin to wane. The village quiets down, and after a few hours laying in the dirt, the sun begins to rise, and you regain control of your bodies.*
